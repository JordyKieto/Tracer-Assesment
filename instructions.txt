The goal of this exercise is to simulate the creation of a report, 
by working with two datasets, and drawing some basic insights. 

QUESTIONS:

1. how many campaigns spent on more than 4 days?
2. which sources reported more "junk" than "noise"?
3. how many source B conversions were there for campaigns targeting NY?
4. what was the total cost per view for all ads of type video, 
    truncated to two decimals?
5. what combination of state and hair color had the best (lowest) CPM?

DETAILS:

- a campaign has an audience, and is unique on ID
- an ad belongs to a campaign, has a type, and is unique on ID
- impressions in source1 are for the entire campaign
- stats in source2 are for the ad date
- {'a':17, 'action':'views'} means source A had 17 views 
- cost per view should only include ads of type VIDEO
- cost per view = video spend / video views
- CPM = spend / impressions * 1000

DELIVERABLES:

    a. your answers in a .txt file
    b. your code with instructions on how to run
    c. your original source1.csv and source2.csv, so we have the data needed
        to re-create your answers
    d. bonus - a run time for your solution :)

NOTES:

In addition to correct answers, We are looking for data structures that would 
allow us to solve any number of questions efficiently, not just these in 
particular.
